Problem-1: Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Tree

Given an integer array nums where the elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height-balanced binary search tree.

Example 1:




Input: nums = [-10,-3,0,5,9]

Output: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5]

Explanation: [0,-10,5,null,-3,null,9] is also accepted:

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,3]

Output: [3,1]

Explanation: [1,null,3] and [3,1] are both height-balanced BSTs.
 



Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 104

-104 <= nums[i] <= 104

nums is sorted in a strictly increasing order.








Problem-2: Maximum Depth of Binary Tree





Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.

A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

 



Example 1:

Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]

Output: 3








Example 2:

Input: root = [1,null,2]

Output: 2
 




Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 104].

-100 <= Node.val <= 100
